## Before You Run Tests
Be sure to run `npm install @playwright/test@latest` from the root directory if you don't already have Playwright installed. Once that's done, run `npx playwright install` to install the supported Playwright browsers.

To run a test, use `npx playwright test [path to test file]`, i.e. `npx playwright test fetch/fetchTest.test.ts`
